###### File Upload Limits
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=100
BLOCK_EXECUTABLE_UPLOADS=true
BLOCK_ARCHIVE_UPLOADS=true

###### Image Limits
# Max size in megabytes for image processing (default 25MB)
# Used for:
# - image upload size limit
# - reading images into memory for EXIF/thumbnail/optimization
# Set to 0 to disable in-memory image processing limits (not recommended)

###### Image Compression (Upload)
# Force compression for all uploads (ignores optimize parameter in request)
FORCE_IMAGE_COMPRESSION_ENABLED=false

# Compression modes:
# - FORCE_IMAGE_COMPRESSION_ENABLED=true: request compression params are ignored, settings below are used.
# - FORCE_IMAGE_COMPRESSION_ENABLED=false: compression is applied only when request includes "optimize" params.
#   In this mode, settings below act as defaults/limits (e.g. maxDimension is capped).

# Format used by default (webp or avif)
IMAGE_COMPRESSION_FORMAT=webp
# Max dimensions

# Strip metadata (EXIF/ICC/XMP) during compression
IMAGE_COMPRESSION_STRIP_METADATA=false
# Enable lossless compression
IMAGE_COMPRESSION_LOSSLESS=false
# Shared quality/effort settings for both WebP and AVIF.
# Format-specific knobs are intentionally not exposed because the output format is not expected
# to change frequently. If needed, legacy variables are still supported as a fallback.
IMAGE_COMPRESSION_QUALITY=80
IMAGE_COMPRESSION_EFFORT=6
# AVIF chroma subsampling.
# When unset, subsampling is not overridden (sharp encoder default is used).
# Reasonable values:
# - 4:2:0: smallest file size (recommended)
# - 4:4:4: better color fidelity, usually larger
